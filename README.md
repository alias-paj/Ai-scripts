# Automating tasks in Adobe Illustrator

**Adobe Illustrator** might be the leading standard for vector graphics, however it lacks a some basic functionalities in batch processing. Scaling multipe objects to an absolute value is not possible, as well as replacing multiple items by an other one. I wrote the following scripts to make my life in **Adobe Illustrator** easier and save me a lot of time.

## Scripts
This repository includes the following of my scripts: 
 - [**ScaleByValue**](projects/ScaleByValue.jsx) 
scales each **item** to a specific value (e.g. 5 mm) instead by a given precentage (e.g. 80%).
 - [**BatchReplace**](projects/BatchReplace.jsx)
replaces all **item**s in a selection with the mosttop one.
 - [**DrawColourPalette**](projects/DrawColourPalette.jsx)
draws a colour palette of all **global colour**s present in the user's selection.
 - [**SwapGroupLayer**](projects/SwapGroupLayer.jsx)
translates a **nested layers** to **nested groups** and vice versa.
 - [**RenameByType**](projects/RenameByType.jsx) 
renames all **items** in a document based on their **typename**.
 - [**Subselect**](projects/subSelect.jsx)
helps you to refine your selection by **number of points**, **path length**, and **path area**.

For further information on the possibilities and restrictions of each script read the **README** inside the projects folder.
