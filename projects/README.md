# General Information

> I moved the detailed descriptions of the scripts to individual files. 


## ScaleByValue
**Adobe Illustrator** by default does only allow to batch scale **items** (Object > Transfrom > **Transform Each...** ) by a given scaling factor (e.g. 80% ), but not to a fixed value (e.g. 10 mm ). This script overcomes this lack in functionality by allowing you to scale almost every given object to a fixed value.

## DrawColourPalette
This script creates a **Colour Palette** or  **Look Up Table (LUT)** based **global colour**s used in the user's selection. In addition it saves all processed colour information in a **tab-delimited table** for easy copy and paste. <br> I do recomended to copy the text into a *.txt-file and modify the table to your needs before importing it into excle or any other program.

## BatchReplace
Replacing the shapes of multiple itmes at once is not possible. Using **Symbols** allows you to change the shape and apperance of many instances at once, but this does not work for imported vector images, like graphs. This script allows you to replace multiple items by one defined key item.
