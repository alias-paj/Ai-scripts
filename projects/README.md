# General Information

> I moved the detailed descriptions of the scripts to individual files. 


## ScaleByValue
**Adobe Illustrator** by default does only allow to batch scale **items** (Object > Transfrom > **Transform Each...** ) by a given scaling factor (e.g. 80% ), but not to a fixed value (e.g. 10 mm ). This script overcomes this lack in functionality by allowing you to scale almost every given object to a fixed value.

## DrawColourPalette
This script creates a **Colour Palette** or  **Look Up Table (LUT)** based **global colour**s used in the user's selection. In addition it saves all processed colour information in a **tab-delimited table** for easy copy and paste. <br> I do recomended to copy the text into a *.txt-file and modify the table to your needs before importing it into excle or any other program.

## BatchReplace
Replacing the shapes of multiple itmes at once is not possible. Using **Symbols** allows you to change the shape and apperance of many instances at once, but this does not work for imported vector images, like graphs. This script allows you to replace multiple items by one defined key item.

## RenameByType
It is hard to distiguish different types of objects in the layers panel. **Adobe Illustrator** does not used icons like **Blender** does. To overcome this issue I use a nameing pattern to idicate if I am dealing with an **Group** or **Clipping Mask**, with an **Compound Path** or just a regular **Path**. This script applies my naming pattern to all objects in the active document. I did not define some item types.

## SwapGroupLayer
>Application: Adobe Illustrator<br>
Version: 22.0 and above

Organising your file strucute in Adobe Illustrator can be tidious. **Layers** are good to keep things structured while still be able to easy select and modify items within. **Groups** are good to keep things together and not accedently change things, while still be able to move and transform the whole group. While both have their pros and cons it is hard to switch between them, especially if you have **nested layer** or **group structures**. <br>
This script allows to switch between nested layer structures and group structures in one click.
